The Alchemist's Daughter: A Novel,Bookreporter,5,"The most any of us probably learned about the arcane discipline of alchemy is that it had something to do with turning base metals into gold. What far fewer of us may realize is how much the fanciful and seemingly impossible principles of alchemy contributed to the hard sciences of today, such as physics and chemistry.In THE ALCHEMIST'S DAUGHTER, British novelist Katharine McMahon has stepped boldly into that shadowy period during the early 1700s when alchemy was in its twilight and the new physical sciences --- identified by such luminaries as Sir Isaac Newton --- were emerging into daylight.For those at the top of the great societal heap known in Britain and Europe as the Age of Enlightenment, the whole universe must have seemed ripe for the picking. Scientific discoveries had vastly improved navigation, trade, medicine and manufacturing, bringing exciting new products, pastimes and services into the lives of those able to afford them.Living outside London in a rundown rural estate on the periphery of all this activity, Emilie Selden, an unlikely apprentice to her reclusive widowed father, grows up as a rigorously trained natural scientist and philosopher. Barely aware of social graces, human emotions or the domestic arts, Emilie spends most of her first 19 years immersed in the intellectual crucible of her father's laboratory.Then the opposite sex happens. Now that would seem almost a basic necessity for a historical novel, except that at this point several things could happen. The story could have dissolved into a banal romance with the usual steamy vocabulary; it could have forged virtuously onward as a boring triumph of feminist brains over shallow amour; or it could have lost its way entirely and become a social justice tract about how hard life could be for the working classes.But this is where THE ALCHEMIST'S DAUGHTER shows much more than its scholarly mettle. From this most delicate turning point --- the year 1725 ""when everything changed"" in Emilie's retrospective eye --- McMahon achieves a brilliant, poignant and utterly unforgettable tour de force that weaves together the real complexity of human confusion and aspiration.It's not only about a brilliant young woman surviving on the edge of her social and historical milieu; it's not only about love betrayed and love fiercely guarded; and it's not only about the thundering clash of ignorance and ethics. In McMahon's supple and experienced hands, her story is all of this and much more. Emilie is so fully and powerfully drawn that she fills, overflows, the strangely diverse historical container in which she began, herself a secret ""experiment"" whose conclusion is yet to be.Through Emilie's reflections, notes, diaries and disasters, THE ALCHEMIST'S DAUGHTER takes you from the glories of the Age of Enlightenment to the foul underside of British 18th-century life, and everywhere in between. It's a page-turner with startling beauty and substance that takes the strange alchemy of a confused and confusing time and refines it into true gold. This is easily Katharine McMahon's best work yet.--- Reviewed by Pauline Finch (paulinefinch@rogers.com)"
Black Notice,A Customer,1,Patricia Cornwall has managed to turn this reader from one who could not wait for her next book to be released to one who is finished reading them. It may suprise her to learn that the sexual orientation of a person only clutters up a good story unless it has DIRECT bearing on the story being told. Lucy needs to get a life and grow up. I really miss the excitement of the her earlier books. I have found this nagging issue true of her last 3 novels.
Guilty As Sin,A Customer,1,"It's a great first sentence, I admit, but let's look at the rest of the book.I read the prologue and the first two chapters. Only 35 of its 606 pages, which violates my informal ""10% rule."" Did I read enough? Actually, I read too much. I was treated to overfamiliar cardboard characters, equally overfamiliar cliches, awkward language, cutesy language, wordy language, the telling of scenes that should be shown, and the showing of scenes that should be told. Hoag has been a regular on the best seller lists since 1988, but not because of anything I bought. I'm returning this to the book swap at the Jazz Pub here in Hangzhou and bringing home something else."
The Family Trade (Merchant Princes),Bookreporter,5,"You have to love a book that starts out with this kind of a bang: ""Ten and a half hours before a mounted knight with a machine gun tried to kill her, tech journalist Miriam Beckstein lost her job. Before the day was out, her pink slip would set in train a chain of events that would topple governments, trigger civil wars, and kill thousands.""The trouble starts when Miriam uncovers an enormous money-laundering scheme. When she brings it to the attention of her boss, she's instantly fired. As it turns out, Miriam's now ex-employer's parent company is deep in the action. Miriam visits her ailing adoptive mother, who gives her newspaper articles about Miriam's birth mother --- a ""Jane Doe"" who was stabbed to death. The murdered woman's baby, Miriam, was adopted. Now Miriam's adoptive mother challenges Miriam to investigate the murder.Along with the papers, Miriam receives a locket worn by her murdered mother. As she examines it, she sees blue-white lights, smells burning toast, her stomach is upset, the light goes out, and she falls down. When she rises, she is no longer in her home. Instead, she's outside in a forest. As she attempts to orient herself, she spies a most disorienting sight --- armored knights riding horses toward her, and shooting at her. She gazes again at the locket and finds herself near her home.Miriam decides she must return to the mysterious place. Not only must she satisfy her journalist's curiosity, but she also needs to find the connection that the strange forest may have with her birth mother. After her life is threatened concerning her knowledge of the money-laundering scheme, she suspects that she may someday have to travel to the forest to hide. However, that makes her wonder: if her birth mother could have escaped to the other world, why hadn't she done so to escape her murderer?As Miriam sleeps in her own bed, she is kidnapped. Her kidnappers wear swords and call Miriam ""your highness."" The reader discovers what happens when take-charge Miriam finds herself in an unbearable and dangerous situation. Her actions set this series in motion, leaving us anxious for volume two of the series. Can Miriam single-handedly drag her new world out of the middle ages? Can she somehow change the despicable trade her family is engaged in? And, with her life in constant danger, will she survive to accomplish her lofty goals?THE FAMILY TRADE's characters are endearingly flawed and likeable. The pace is quick, with many unusual twists in the plot, and the story is riveting from the first sentence --- an excellent read!

The Mammoth Cheese,Bookreporter,4,"As I was reading Sheri Holman's new novel, THE MAMMOTH CHEESE, on the subway, I received countless comments from strangers on the book's title. ""THE MAMMOTH CHEESE,"" more than one person said to me, ""What's THAT about?"" Although many of the novel's situations --- and certainly its title --- are rather absurd, the novel touches on themes that are anything but silly.Sheri Holman, whose previous novels, A STOLEN TONGUE and THE DRESS LODGER, were set in Palestine and England, respectively, here writes a novel that is not only American in its setting and scope but also quintessentially American in its themes of self-reliance, family obligation and, most importantly, independence. In many ways THE MAMMOTH CHEESE is an extended meditation on the concept of independence, explored through the examples of several carefully drawn small-town folks from rural Three Chimneys, Virginia.There's Manda Frank, part of Three Chimneys's most notorious white-trash family, who finds herself the mother of eleven babies after a fertility drug proves a little too effective. Counseled by her pastor to keep all the babies, Manda is completely bewildered by her new responsibilities. When some of the babies start to die, Manda is torn between anguish at her loss and relief at the prospect of regaining the freedom she has always valued and the ability to hunt and roam the woods with her beloved dogs, a freedom that motherhood seems to have stolen entirely.Also struggling with his own independence is August Vaughn. By day, August is a farmhand on Margaret Prickett's small dairy farm. By night, he dresses up as Thomas Jefferson to interpret Jefferson's life and writings to audiences of locals and tourists alike. Even though August reveres the man famous for writing the Declaration of Independence, he is unable to declare his own independence. He's in thrall both to his parents, with whom he has lived as an adult for more than twenty years, and to his long hidden and unrequited love for Margaret.Margaret, too, must define what independence means to her. Recently divorced from her husband, she's struggling to keep her small dairy farm afloat while raising her 13-year-old daughter Polly, protecting her from the corrupting influences of modern life. Margaret has pinned all her financial hopes on newly elected President Adams Brooke, who has run on a platform of granting debt amnesty to America's small farmers. As a dramatic expression of her gratitude, Margaret is determined to present President Brooke with a 1,200-pound cheese, a gesture reminiscent of a gift given to Jefferson during his presidency. Soon, though, the mammoth cheese gets out of Margaret's control, and she must decide how far to take the media circus that ensues.Finally, there's Polly, Margaret's teenage daughter, who loves her mother fiercely but feels lost in the wake of her parents' divorce and the drama of her mother's struggles to save her farm. She is drawn to her history teacher, Mr. March, whose favorite Jeffersonian motto is ""Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God."" Mr. March paints himself as a radical and encourages Polly to rebel, but it soon becomes clear that his interest in Polly is more sinister than a desire to help her gain her independence.Amazingly enough, all of these threads do come together during the Mammoth Cheese's pilgrimage to Washington, D.C. Without being preachy or predictable, THE MAMMOTH CHEESE manages to incorporate some big ideas about the nature of independence and the character of America.--- Reviewed by Norah Piehl"
Shooting Script a Novel of Suspense,Bookreporter,4,"There is a part of me that is constantly amazed whenever I turn on a television or slip a DVD into the player and see something actually materialize on the screen. All we ever see is the end result of a process that is so convoluted, illogical, and laborious that it's a wonder that the only thing that ever shows up on a movie or a television screen is a test pattern (of course, I have the same reaction whenever I crack the binding on a new book and actually see something in print, but that's another story).There are a lot of projects, however, that start off as a good idea and never happen. Ever see a film called LaBrava, starring Dustin Hoffman? Of course not. Didn't happen. It almost happened, but as my firearms trainer once told me, ""almost"" only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades. Another project that ""almost"" happened is a legendary film by Jerry Lewis --- yes, that Jerry Lewis --- titled The Day the Clown Cried. Clown, a rare dramatic vehicle for Lewis that was filmed in 1972, may never see the light of day, for a variety of reasons. Naturally, everyone who knows about it wants to see it. And that, of course, would include Roy Milano, Laurence Klavan's film-obsessed creation, who makes a welcome return in THE SHOOTING SCRIPT.The general object of Milano's obsession is film trivia, to the extent that he is able to think of little else. Indeed, odd pieces of trivia pop into and out of Milano's consciousness, unbidden, at the most inappropriate times --- including, but not limited to, moments of near-death. Milano encounters several of these moments in THE SHOOTING SCRIPT, almost from the minute he receives a cryptic call from a stranger concerning a long-sought copy of the Jerry Lewis movie. The call leads Milano to a somewhat manic and madcap pursuit of the film, from New York to Los Angeles, to Amsterdam and back again, shadowed all the while by a mystery man who will stop at nothing to get the film for himself. Milano reprises his role in 2004's THE CUTTING ROOM as an almost-lovable nudge who would get a life except for the fact that he is enjoying his neurosis too much to do so.Klavan, while not a deep literary writer, is an extremely entertaining one, and his plot holds together, hilariously, as a vehicle for the presentation of arcane film facts. In THE SHOOTING SCRIPT Milano's fixation is with what actor/director replaced what actor/director in which film. The trivia is extremely interesting if you have even a passing interest in film history, and if you are as obsessed with it as Milano, you will find the narrative to be riveting as the facts come flying at you.THE SHOOTING SCRIPT establishes that Klavan has a winning franchise with Milano and this series. Given that Klavan has several decades' worth of film history to work with, we hopefully can look forward to much more of Klavan, and Milano, in the years to come.

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass,A Customer,5,"Find some children anywhere you can and read this book to them! I say this for your pleasure at least as much as theirs. Reading it out loud will be one of the delightful experiences of your life. Did I say ""reading?"" I should have said ""performing,"" because you will not be able to resist acting it out. Let yourself go--you will be a child again, yet still appreciate the book's adult insights.There is so much to say about this classic. It captures the psychology of a girl on the verge of growing up; it is full of jokes that appear absurd, but are fiendishly clever; it somehow avoids anything old-fashioned or politically incorrect; and absolutely all the characters are loveable, no matter how hard they try not to be.Carroll was an unhappy, aging man, yet he understood children to a spooky degree. While I smiled mildly at some of the humor, my children rolled around on the floor laughing.Here is an interesting phenomenon: When I read it as a child, I didn't particularly warm to it. When my children tried to read it on their own, they gave up. But the group experience of reading it out loud was a joy for all.Do I need to describe the plot? Could I if I tried? Alice may or may not be dreaming when she follows a rabbit down into his hole and enters a world where the simplest actions are strange and complicated. In her effort to explore this world and ultimately return home, nothing fits right, nothing seems to follow through properly, and no one she meets is sane. Alice, though a little girl, is given plenty of opportunities to be the rational, mature, assertive person of action.Everyone I discuss this book with, and I mean everyone, shudders and raises the issue of Carroll's alleged improprieties. They are invisible in the book, but to put your mind at ease, you may want to check out the judicious biography by Morton N. Cohen.The particular edition of Alice in Wonderland that I am reviewing, published by Grosset, is especially pleasant for reading out loud, with comfortable print, and Tenniel's essential illustrations."
"Persuader (Jack Reacher, No. 7)",A Customer,5,Having never read a Reacher novel before I wasnt sure what to expect. I found this story to be almost addicting. The author captured me and made it very difficult to put down my kindle. Thank you for allowing me to experience this. I am hoping to read all the Reacher novels from number1 to the end.
"Persuader (Jack Reacher, No. 7)",Bookreporter,4,"Bestselling author Lee Child and his fictitious hero Jack Reacher are back in action. PERSUADER is Child's seventh consecutive novel about the former military man with a mysterious past. He gets into plenty of trouble when he stumbles upon a kidnapping attempt of a well-to-do college student and decides to take a closer look.Having never read a Child novel before, I was extremely impressed at how the author wastes no time in placing the reader right into the thick of the action. From the start of the first chapter, the suspense and action never seems to slow down. With bullets flying past him, Reacher is able to safely return Richard Beck to his parents' palatial compound on an island off the coast of Maine, whereupon Reacher discovers Beck is no ordinary college student --- he's the son of affluent Oriental rug importer Zachary Beck. Without giving too much of the story away, the kidnapping that Reacher stumbles upon wasn't actually a kidnapping at all, but a staged event that Reacher and some federal agents organized to get Reacher inside the Beck fortress.Fans of Child's Reacher novels should remember the name Francis Xavier Quinn, a former villain Reacher thought he had done away with 10 years ago, until he sees Quinn walk past him on a busy Boston street. As the story's plot continues to unravel, Child reveals that the elder Beck has somehow intertwined his life and his family in some sort of blackmailing scheme with the likes of Quinn.Child pushes all the right buttons to convey to his audience that Reacher isn't just some washed up GI; he is a well-informed killing machine somewhat similar to the late Ian Fleming's Bond, James Bond. Reacher is well versed in the art of self defense, can handle numerous types of weapons, swims in the icy cold Atlantic Ocean and even plays a game of Russian roulette to show Beck he should be taken extremely serious. And, of course, Reacher does extremely well with the ladies as Reacher and DEA agent Susan Duffy toss aside their working relationship and dive head first into a torrid affair. Another interesting aspect about PERSUADER is how Child is able to keep the reader constantly guessing and the pages turning.Although Child's serial character hasn't even scratched the surface in terms of popularity, like James Patterson's Alex Cross, Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan or Robert B. Parker's Spencer has, the former television writer and England native undoubtedly has a following that will continue to grow with this fine new novel.--- Reviewed by David Exum"

Night and Day,Bookreporter,5,"Robert B. Parker is the acknowledged dean of American crime fiction. His creation of the private eye with no first name, Spenser, revitalized the genre almost four decades ago, and the series has since become a classic of American literature. But Parker took a risk in 1997 when he branched out and introduced a new series starring small town Massachusetts police chief Jesse Stone. The comparisons to Spenser were inevitable.NIGHT AND DAY is the eighth novel featuring Stone. And the writing is so good that the arrival of a new Stone story is as much a cause for rejoicing as the arrival of a Spenser novel. Just as with Spenser, the Stone books are getting stronger with each outing. In Stone, Parker has created a more complex, troubled hero than his wisecracking Boston detective, Spenser.Paradise is a small town on the Massachusetts coast with a police force of only 12 members. Jesse's chief assistant and partner in playful banter is Molly, the only woman on the force. At one point in NIGHT AND DAY, she says, ""I feel like I am serving and protecting Sodom and Gomorrah.""Well, maybe.The perversity starts when Betsy Ingersoll, the female principal of the junior high, marches all the young girls into a locker room before a dance and orders them to lift their skirts. She needs to inspect their underwear to prevent them from becoming ""sluts."" Complicating matters is the fact that Ingersoll's husband is the managing partner of the biggest law firm in the state.Jesse is not sure what the principal can be charged with, but he wants to do something to stand up for the violated privacy rights of the kids. His interest deepens when one of the girls tells him of the existence of a ""swingers club"" in the town, with swinging parties going on in her house while she and her younger brother are present. She can come to Jesse for help. ""Most adults aren't like you,"" she tells him.Then there's the weekly Wednesday night appearance of a ""peeping tom"" who not so gradually turns into a home invader. Calling himself ""The Night Hawk"" in creepy letters to Jesse, the man breaks into houses, orders the sole female occupants to strip at gunpoint and then takes pictures of them. Soon the Night Hawk is taunting and almost begging Jesse to stop him before he does something violent.And finally there's the problem of Jesse's alcoholism. His drinking is directly related to his relationship with the love of his life, his ex-wife Jenn. Jesse divorced Jenn back when he was an LA police detective. Having drunk his way off that force, Jesse came east to take the chief's job in the excellent NIGHT PASSAGE, which kicked off the series 12 years ago. But Jenn followed him, and in the years since they have had an on/off relationship. What is clear is that Jesse has never stopped loving her.Now Jenn is gone again and Jesse is hitting the bottle hard at night alone in his apartment, talking to his picture of Ozzie Smith on the wall and mourning both the loss of his woman and his once promising professional baseball career cut short by injury.But he is a functioning alcoholic, reserving his 16-ounce glasses of scotch for his off-duty hours. Jesse goes to therapy, but typically spends most of his time there trying to understand the motivations of the actors in his cases. He is especially worried about the Night Hawk and hopes that by understanding him better, he will be able to stop him.Personal demons aside, Jesse Stone is a great cop; he's compassionate and unable to let go of a case, traits he shares with Parker's greatest creation, Spenser. Jesse says at one point, ""I know better, but I still have to believe that if I keep looking at it and turning it around and rolling around on it, eventually I'll come up with something.""However, the power of NIGHT AND DAY is not just in the fast-moving plot and watching Stone tie all the disparate elements together. This is what good mystery writers do all the time. But Parker is not just good, he's great --- one of the greatest writers to ever work the genre. The greatness in this book is watching Stone struggle to come to grips not just with the obsession that drives the Night Hawk, but with the obsession that is driving and slowly destroying his own life: his obsessive love for Jenn.The true mystery is internal: the psychological struggle that is driving a good man into the darkness. And this is where Parker does some of the greatest writing of his career. Consider the following passage:""Jesse took in some more scotch. That was then. This was now. It all seemed a downward spiral. He was going to be a big time shortstop, and then he wasn't. He was a detective in Robbery Homicide in Los Angeles. Then he wasn't. He was married to Jenn. Then he wasn't. He finished his drink and went back to the bar to make another. He gestured with the full glass toward the picture.""`You and me, Wizard,' he said.""Now he was a small-town cop in the far corner of the country, drinking alone at night and talking to a f****** baseball poster. He took his glass to the chair and sat and looked at the phone. No need to turn the answering machine off, she wasn't calling back. He reached over and turned it on. He looked around the empty room and took a drink.""`After this, what? he said aloud in the empty room.""He sat and thought about what he'd said, and nodded his head slowly, and smiled faintly to himself.""`Nothing,' he said. `Nothing at all.'""Writing does not get any darker or any better than that in the mystery genre, or any other genre for that matter. Reading NIGHT AND DAY is like being in the room when Sinatra belted out the famous Cole Porter song of the same title for the first time.

Equal Rites,A Customer,5,"I've decided he's too good and too prolific for me to write a brand new review every single time I read one of his books. Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat ""Bite me!""I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud.

No, I don't have to have actions spelled out for me, I can pick out subtle undertones as well as the next person. But what made Ripley the person he is? Why did he do what he did? At one point, the relationship between Dickie and Tom is fabulous, the next minute, it's going downhill, because why? I am not sure. Also, maybe the '90's have made me too jaded. After all this book was written in the genteel '50's. But as far as being a psychopathic villain goes,which is what the book tries to make him out to be, Tom Ripley is pretty lame.

Bleeding Hearts,Bookreporter,5,"Whether or not Ian Rankin's John Rebus police procedurals or his stand-alone works are seen as ""literary"" is totally irrelevant to the elements that make all of them exciting, entertaining, often funny, well plotted and a cut above the ordinary. His ironic twists accelerate the pace and keep readers breathlessly carried along by the action. BLEEDING HEARTS is the newest thriller to appear in the United States --- it was published in England in 1994 under the pseudonym Jack Harvey. In it, we follow the trajectories of the lives of two men: an assassin of international repute, and a former NYPD cop now turned private eye who has vowed to track down the infamous killer and execute him.The story opens in a hotel bar in England where me meet the killer, Michael Weston, having a drink with a passing acquaintance. In his first-person narration he tells readers that his mark has only three more hours to live, while opining to his companion: ""You know what it's like these days --- only the toughest are making it. No room for bleeding hearts though of course in my line of work bleeding hearts are the business.""Today his assignment is to shoot a woman who will be leaving a particular hotel, at a particular time, wearing a particular dress patterned in yellow and blue. He has no idea who she is and doesn't really care. Later, as the police show up at almost the precise second he pulls the trigger, he can't believe what has just transpired. How could they be here so quickly? he wonders. His ad-hoc plan to leave the scene is to call 999 and ask for an ambulance because, he tells them, he's ""a severe hemophiliac"" who has been involved in a terrible accident and his head is bleeding.Weston in fact is a hemophiliac, albeit a mild one, and this twist adds verisimilitude to the character that is more cerebral than physical. As happens in life, his illness is a curse and a blessing --- this time it is his means of escape and soon he is free. He now can ponder what went wrong; this was supposed to be an easy hit. His conclusion: he had to have been set up --- but by whom, and why?Weston must escape to safety and makes his way to an isolated farm where Max and his daughter Belle live. They deal in arms of every sort and sell to anyone with enough cash to pay for them. Weston needs their support and access to their cache. He rests a bit and plans an assault on a so-far phantom enemy.Weston has always worked through a middleman, the gunrunner Max. He never wanted to get ""personally involved"" with his victims or paymasters. Death is only the result of the job he has to do; it is a fact of life but not necessarily one he cares to analyze. He is very smart, very careful, very dedicated and very lethal. He looks like an average man of a certain age who is personable but reveals nothing about himself to anyone.Meanwhile, in Vine Street police station, Chief Inspector Bob Broome comes to the conclusion that Weston, dubbed the ""Demolition Man,"" is the shooter. But the police have no clear evidence to point to the real target. ""The people on the [hotel] steps, that's another thing. We've got a journalist [dead], a secretary of state, and some senior guy from an East European embassy.""After a powwow with his detectives, Broome makes a call to the United States --- to Leo Hoffer, who ran his own detective agency. These days, Hoffer's only personal client is Robert Walkins, the father of a young woman who the Demolition Man killed in a freak accident, which so far was Weston's only miss. Walkins and Hoffer have been obsessed with finding the D-Man and killing him.Ian Rankin is one of those writers whose prose grabs the reader with the first line. From there it's a heady journey through a fast-paced, intelligent plotline, awash with characters who jump off the page and a climax that turns everything the reader was thinking upside down. BLEEDING HEARTS is not only a thriller about a sniper and the man who tracks him. It is also a story that is timely and raises issues of good and evil to a higher plane. Rankin wants the reader inside the heads of his anti-hero and his nemesis. Their thoughts, their rationalizations, their uncertainties, their fears and their destinies are central to understanding what motivates these people who do what they do. Readers are asked to ""stand back"" and judge for themselves how evil or good these men are. The supporting characters play no less a part in fleshing out the architecture of the book, and they inhabit the space, each with their own personalities and agendas, be they good or bad.BLEEDING HEARTS is a challenge to read. It is gritty and tough, but that's Rankin's trademark. All of his books explore the dark side of people's lives and the underbellies of space they inhabit --- but he balances that by shining a light into the hidden nooks and the shadowed crannies that ultimately override the bad guys. The body of work he has amassed speaks to his readability and storytelling prowess. And while loyal fans look forward to the next John Rebus installment, BLEEDING HEARTS is one of his best stand-alone novels and is certainly a keeper.--- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum"

When my children tried to read it on their own, they gave up. But the group experience of reading it out loud was a joy for all.Do I need to describe the plot? Could I if I tried? Alice may or may not be dreaming when she follows a rabbit down into his hole and enters a world where the simplest actions are strange and complicated. In her effort to explore this world and ultimately return home, nothing fits right, nothing seems to follow through properly, and no one she meets is sane. Alice, though a little girl, is given plenty of opportunities to be the rational, mature, assertive person of action.Everyone I discuss this book with, and I mean everyone, shudders and raises the issue of Carroll's alleged improprieties. They are invisible in the book, but to put your mind at ease, you may want to check out the judicious biography by Morton N. Cohen.The particular edition of Alice in Wonderland that I am reviewing, published by Grosset, is especially pleasant for reading out loud, with comfortable print, and Tenniel's essential illustrations."
Maggie's Hope,A Customer,5,"Maggie's Hope is a great summer read, specially on the beach! Reading about these robust, hearty women dealing with and overcoming hardships that we can relate to even in modern times, has given me hope that life today ain't all that bad considering the 'good old days'. There are some good characters I loved to hate but I won't say more... Too bad it isn't a paperback, but it's still worth the money."

A Son of the Circus,A Customer,4,"I try to cut authors some slack wherever possible, so I'm giving A SON OF THE CIRCUS four stars rather than three, but it's really more like three and a half. John Irving seems irresistably drawn to transsexuals, yet his portrayals of them continue to be some of the silliest and least convincing I've read. I'm not looking for political correctness, but I do appreciate characters I can believe in. Fortunately, A SON OF THE CIRCUS does have some. The protagonist, Dr. Daruwalla, is well-drawn and likeable. His informally-adopted movie star &quot;son,&quot; John D. (a.k.a. Inspector Dhar), is intriguing. Nancy, a displaced American married to a Bombay policeman, is heartbreaking.Among other things, this is a book about twins, and Irving uses &quot;twinning&quot; in interesting ways throughout the story: several characters are referred to by more than one name; the real crippled boy Ganesh is mirrored by a similar character in Dr. Daruwalla's screenplay. Dr. Daruwalla himself lives not one but two double lives -- as a respectable orthopedic surgeon and a writer of trashy cop movies; as an immigrant in Toronto and a not-quite-Indian in Bombay.This novel disturbed me and I have found myself thinking about it quite a bit in the few days since I finished it. If you're the sort of reader who believes these are good things, you may well enjoy it too."
The Kill Clause: A Novel,Bookreporter,4,"THE KILL CLAUSE begins in the midst of a tragedy, perhaps the worst personal tragedy the mind can comprehend. On her seventh birthday Ginny Rackley is abducted, raped and brutally murdered. The first chapter opens with her parents, Tim and Dray Rackley, receiving the news and continues with an unblinking description of their reaction to the permanent horror that has entered their lives. A suspect is almost immediately arrested and the case appears to be open and shut, until a surprise revelation destroys the prosecution's case. The result is that a monstrous murderer walks free.Tim and Dray are both members of law enforcement --- Tim is a U.S. Marshal, Dray is an L.A. County Sheriff --- and the horror of their loss is multiplied by the fact that the system they are sworn to uphold has set the murderer of their only daughter free. Tim and Dray seem to freefall through life while grief and sadness cause their marriage to slowly but inexorably self-destruct.Things begin to change, however, when Tim is approached by an enigmatic man with a mysterious offer that gives Tim the opportunity to set things right. Tim is offered membership into the Commission, a shadowy group of five men and one woman, all professionals in their respective fields, all of whom have watched the murderers of loved ones go free. The Commission seeks to right judicial wrongs by executing murderers freed by the legal system --- and one of the individuals targeted by the Commission is Ginny's murderer. The Commission appears to be the ideal check and balance to a court system that seems to punish the victim and protect the criminal. Nothing though is as simple as it appears, and the Commission seemingly hides the darkest, most terrible secret of all.THE KILL CLAUSE is loaded with moral dilemmas. Some (including this reviewer) may find the ending not to be entirely satisfying, but the ultimate aim of this fine novel is not simply to entertain but to get the reader thinking about the consequences of stepping outside the system in order to obtain a measure of justice that otherwise is denied. If that was indeed Hurwitz's intent, he has succeeded. THE KILL CLAUSE will keep you awake and thinking --- both while you read it and after you finish it.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub from Bookreporter.com"
In the Company of Liars,Bookreporter,5,"I initially had some doubts about IN THE COMPANY OF LIARS, David Ellis's new novel. The element that (momentarily) brought me up short was the revelation that the narrative is in chronological reverse. This method, though unusual, is not unknown, nor is it limited to novels. The problem is that it is occasionally employed as a trick of form to distract from the substance of the piece. An example of this is Coldplay's video for ""The Scientist,"" where the method is utilized as a stalking horse to keep the viewer awake during the song.But it turns out there was no reason for me to worry. Ellis has demonstrated in previous works such as LINE OF VISION and LIFE SENTENCE that he need only rely on his prodigious reserve of talent to carry the day. The same holds true here.The use of the chronological reverse with respect to IN THE COMPANY OF LIARS is a plot device that functions as a bit of lagniappe to the primary strength of the narrative rather than having to carry the day. It also, incidentally, presents a dilemma for reviewers faced with the task of providing a sufficient summary of the plot without giving everything away.Let us try. Allison Pagone is accused of murdering her former lover, Sam Dillon, a lobbyist whose company is the subject of a Federal investigation. The evidence against Pagone is damning, and she has done the prosecution the favor of behaving like a guilty party as well. When she is found to have committed suicide, with the weapon that murdered Dillon on the premises, the conclusion is that she has saved the prosecution's time and some taxpayer dollars.But, but...well, that is only the beginning. And the beginning raises a bunch of questions, including whether Pagone actually did the deed. If she didn't do it, who did? And what is the connection between a murder committed by a jilted lover and the attack upon and capture of a Middle Eastern terrorist? These intriguing questions are more than enough, on their own, to keep you up all night reading this novel. Yet the star here is Ellis, who leads the reader through a minefield of potential distractions with nary a misstep. And that's while walking backward, no less.IN THE COMPANY OF LIARS is an intriguing, suspenseful, funhouse of a book, with surprises jumping out at you from above, below and sideways. You'll never forget this book, or Ellis, after you've finished reading. Highly recommended.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"
Last Detective,Bookreporter,5,"Robert Crais is best known for his signature character, L.A. Private Investigator Elvis Cole. Crais, however, is too talented a craftsman to rely on a single character, as demonstrated by his recent successes with the brilliant DEMOLITION ANGEL and HOSTAGE. Still, Crais could not keep Cole away forever and, at long last, has given us THE LAST DETECTIVE, a new Elvis Cole novel that will not only sate the appetites of Cole's fan base but also anyone who is a fan of the suspense genre. This is a book that will make you happy that someone took the time to teach you how to read.Crais wastes very little time in setting things up in THE LAST DETECTIVE. Cole's relationship with longtime love Lucy Chenier, already strained by the violence that plagues Cole's life, is further sundered when Chenier's son, Ben, disappears while Cole is babysitting him. Cole initially believes that Ben has temporarily run away due to the strain between Cole and Chenier, but a menacing telephone call soon demonstrates that Ben has been deliberately abducted for reasons of revenge having to do with Cole's dark past. At the same time, Cole's partner, Joe Pike, is dealing with the aftermath of injuries he sustained during the events of L.A. REQUIEM and finds himself unsure of his limits and abilities at a time when they, and he, will be tested to their utmost.Complicating matters further is the arrival of Richard Chenier, Lucy's ex-husband, a wealthy and obnoxious industrialist who attempts to take over the investigation. A surprise and welcome return also occurs with the prominent reappearance of Carol Starkey, introduced in DEMOLITION ANGEL and now working in the LAPD Juvenile Division. As Cole and Pike, the police and Richard Chenier conduct their investigations, often at cross-purposes, into Ben's disappearance, Cole is forced to confront his history and his life --- and how these elements affect those whom he loves. Crais, meanwhile, writes as if he is working against the stopwatch, ratcheting the suspense level up, up, up until it is almost painful. You won't get even a quarter of the way through this book without putting the completion of reading it on the top of your &quot;to do&quot; list.Be forewarned: this is a dark tale, one that eschews the wisecracking Cole of old. There is no humor here, no happy ending. The reader is given new insight not only into Cole, but also into Pike, perhaps one of the most interesting secondary characters in detective fiction since Robert Parker's Hawk. Pike is one of those people who would frighten you, even if he was on your side. God help you if he was coming for you. Seemingly invincible in previous Elvis Cole novels, Pike is slower, more vulnerable and, ultimately, more believable in THE LAST DETECTIVE. He is all the more frightening for it.If you haven't read anything by Crais for a while, or if you have never encountered him before, THE LAST DETECTIVE is a great place to begin the experience. Just leave some time to explore the backlist of this underrated author who is slowly but inexorably receiving the attention he has so long deserved. Highly recommended.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"
Closed Circle,A Customer,4,"I have been a book addict since little and specailly a mistery novel fan. Recently, I often got so bored with junk publication of mystery novels but When I first encountered his book I knew that he was genius! TAKE NO FAREWELL, PAINTING THE DARKNESS, PAST CARING, INTO THE BLUE, HAND IN GLOVE, BEYOND RECALL, OUT OF SUN.... I still have more Goddards to read but my personal top 3 so far would be PAINTING THE DARKNESS, PAST CARING and INTO THE BLUE. CLOSED CIRCLE is a good book although it may lack the twist and mystery compared to other books by Goddard. But I am so attached to this book and keep reading in order just to reach the ending, which is my favorite part and the most beautiful ending by Goddard which envoke visual and emotional sensation as if I were there. The last few sentences, I can even recall as it is so beautiful and so sad. (This novel is not as sad as other Goddard's books, though) I would love to read sequal if any."
Everything's Eventual: 14 Dark Tales,A Customer,4,"There was a time when Stephen King was one of my favorite authors. Then I started hanging out with a better class of authors, hehe. But now, he is once again one of my favorite authors. As I said before, he's raised his game. ON WRITING and everything after. If it's a re-issue of an oldie, well, it has a new introduction by the guy who wrote ON WRITING, and that alone makes it worth buying again. Truly, I love every word he's published for the past five years. The guy was already (perhaps) the best seller of all time, and he wasn't satisfied. How great is that?What we have here is a collection of 14 short stories, some just creepy/scary and others literary. It's a wonderful mix of what we've always known he excels at and what we may not have realized he excels at. Several months back, I heard some scary rumors to the effect that he might retire. That is not allowed. Stephen, if you retire, I'm gonna round up Annie Wilkes and we're gonna make you shave Picasso's neck. So there!"
Angels Fall,Bookreporter,5,"Nora Roberts and the New York Times bestseller list go hand in hand. Since 1999, every book published under her name has hit this list. With more than 280 million books in print, an average of 21 Nora Roberts books sold every minute, 124 New York Times bestsellers and over two million hits a month to her website, Roberts has legions of fans eagerly awaiting her next books --- and upcoming movies. Lifetime Television announced in February 2006 that they will produce four Lifetime Original Movies over the next year based on her bestselling novels.Everything about Roberts's latest release, ANGELS FALL, is breathtaking --- the writing, the romance, the rapture of the summer scenery amidst the Grand Tetons. The wide open spaces that surround the ""snow-dipped peaks of the Tetons"" and the warm reception the heroine receives from a group of small town characters is a welcome break from the many recently released Chick Lit books set amidst the glitz and glamour of New York, Paris and St. Barts. I will be the first to say that I love glitz and glamour, but the majestic setting and vivid descriptions of ""miles of wildflowers on the sage flats"" of Wyoming drew me enticingly to a place I'd never been. That is what a good book does --- it allows you to escape to another place and experience new things that persuade you to grow as a person.Healing from the trauma of a near-death situation, Reece Gilmore finds peace and Brody, a sexy novelist in this small-town, put-the-pieces-of-the-puzzle-together novel. When Reece arrives in Angels Fist, population 623, she is skittish, paranoid and fanatical about locking doors. She has panic dreams about being the lone survivor of a random killing spree in the Boston restaurant where she worked. All of her close friends and co-workers were killed and she bears the scar of the gunshot wound that nearly ended her life. Reece has spent time in a psychiatric hospital, but left Boston and traveled cross country to ""settle in for a few weeks, pick up some work...then move on...""As luck would have it, the town diner is looking for a cook. Reece is enticed by the opportunity to get back into a kitchen, a place she once called home, and decides to stay in Angel's Fist and work for Joanie, a tough but fair businesswoman who still smokes Marlboro Lights. Linda-gail is a waitress in this small town diner, in love with Lo, Joanie's son and town heartthrob. Linda-gail's friendship becomes a healing force for Reece, who in the first week of settling into Angel's Fist witnesses a murder down by the river. Brody is the only one who believes her story. He sees the terror in her eyes and knows she is not crazy. The killer covers his tracks well and begins to stalk Reece with a series of subtle events designed to make her think she's losing it again, but she is determined to uncover the identity of the murdered woman, despite the sheriff's inability to find a trace of evidence. Several characters become prime suspects in the reader's mind, and Roberts masterfully reveals the weakness that leads to murder.As the romance between Reece and Brody builds to tantalizing ecstasy, Brody wonders if this is where he ""wants to be."" ""He wanted most to comfort her, to smooth out all her troubles. No one else had ever reached that tenderness inside him, no one else had ever coaxed it out until it drenched him."" Roberts writes the male perspective with raw intensity. Brody's surprise picnic for Reece exceeds romantic fantasy. The location is where Reece and Brody shared their first kiss, the scenery is ""pinks and blues, vibrant reds and purples, sunny yellows spiked and spread among the soft green of sage"" --- ""not only wine, but cheese and bread and fat purple grapes,"" the scorching kiss framed by ""the sun sliding behind the mountain.""The rhythm of doing what is familiar keeps Reece from believing she's the ""town cuckoo."" Reece brings her Cordon Bleu gourmet cuisine, fresh herbs and paninis to Joanie's diner, where elk chops and stew reign. It's a combination that allows each woman their creativity. A day in Manhattan is more my style, but a moose crossing the road and the majesty of the ""white-frosted mountains"" that ""stood in dazzling splendor"" reminded me that simplicity can be so perfect. As the mystery of murder in a small town unfolds, so does a bright future for Reece. Some men come into your life when you need them most and make a profound and lasting impact; they remember what your favorite flower is and give a bouquet of them to you with love in their eyes and their hearts. Brody lets Reece know that she is where he wants to be.--- Reviewed by Hillary Wagy"

Love in the Asylum : A Novel,Bookreporter,4,"Love is a complicated thing. It is complicated enough without the added stresses of extreme factors such as mental or physical illness, drug addiction or a difficult childhood. But as Lisa Carey demonstrates in her latest novel, LOVE IN THE ASYLUM, love happens and flourishes regardless of such circumstances. And sometimes love grows in the most unlikely of places.Alba Elliot, a children's author, has been suffering with debilitating mental illness for the past ten years. She has been in and out of the Abenaki Mental Hospital all of that time. Cool and jaded, masking a deep sadness and loss, Alba feels comfortable in the walls and on the lawns of Abenaki. When heroin addict Oscar Jameson is admitted to the drug rehab unit, Alba's comfort is challenged. The attraction between the two is almost instantaneous, but neither is prepared emotionally for what they are feeling. Thirty-year-old Oscar is detoxing and is not convinced rehab is the place for him or that he is finally done with drugs. He is fascinated by Alba but still preoccupied with drugs and his own issues, not in the least his troubled relationship with his brother. Alba likes Oscar but hates the fact that he is a junkie. Both have a complicated past that colors all they do and feel in the present. Still, on the lawn of Abenaki, something is developing between them.Around the time Oscar is checked into Abenaki, Alba, while working in the hospital library, comes across a series of letters from a woman who was a patient to her young son. In the 1930s Mary Doherty was put in the hospital by her husband, and there she remained until she died almost ten years later. She was accused of hysteria, of setting fires and believing herself to be a powerful healer in touch with the realm of the dead. As Alba reads the letters, never sent as Mary was forbidden contact with her family, she learns more and more of Mary's tragic history. Mary, whose real name was Mesatawe, was an Abenaki Indian, gifted with a unique power (diagnosed later by doctors as epilepsy and treated with electroshock therapy), and a drive to help heal the other women at the hospital. As we read the letters along with Alba we learn of Mary's special connection to her son Peter, the intended recipient of the letters.Mary's letters to Peter reopen a never quite healed wound in Alba, and soon Alba and Oscar run away from the hospital in search of the now elderly Peter and a type of healing impossible within the walls of Abenaki.LOVE IN THE ASYLUM is not just the story of Alba and Oscar, although their tentative, sweet and emotionally difficult affair is at the center of the novel. It is also the story of familial love. There is the enabling love between Alba and her father, and there is the frustrating love between Oscar and his brother, where a violent past lays just below the surface. There is especially the love of mothers for sons; Mary's for Peter and the raw love that Alba feels for the son she lost a decade ago.Carey's novel is wonderfully written, honest and emotional without sentimentality. It is simply a joy to read. She successfully weaves the stories of Alba, Oscar and Mary and unifies them into a poignant whole. The devastating losses felt by the characters are offset with just enough humor to keep the novel from being sappy, boring or overly tragic. Despite the fact that the novel wraps up a little too neatly at the end, this is a highly recommendable novel from a creative and talented author.--- Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman"

"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)",A Customer,3,"Mostly a riveting; spellbinding novel until the last few chapters. Like the other McCarthy titles &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot;, etc. he accomplishes a feel for the desert Southwest like no other author I have read. He does that by painting a graphicly accurate word picture of the area. In addition, through the eyes of the Kid, he makes the reader feel, not just read, the era in which the story is set. I came away drained from the intensity. However, I feel that the philosophical journeys into which the judge wanders are too lengthy and too esoteric. If you want a philosophical discussion, go to a text book. Not only would some, if not most, disagree with the Judge's view of life, it in no way enhanced the story. If you are looking for another &quot;Ox Bow Incident&quot; you will be extremely disappointed. While the philosophical mindset of Ox Bow was more visceral and real, Blood Meridian was much more off the chart and contrived. In addition, McCarthy's use of the Spanish language, was over used. This book is written in English for English speaking readers. An occasional use of a foreign language should be used in moderation and never to convey critical aspects of the story. McCarthy has not accomplished that knack yet, in any of his novels that I have read."

A Faint Cold Fear,Bookreporter,4,"With her earlier Grant County novels, BLINDSIGHTED and KISSCUT, Karin Slaughter has developed a reputation for imagining --- and describing in excruciating detail --- particularly grisly crimes. Her latest venture, A FAINT COLD FEAR, is not for the faint of heart either. Fans of novels by Patricia Cornwell and Kathy Reichs, as well as devotees of the CSI television series, will recognize the familiar territory of the crime scene and autopsy table in Slaughter's work. It's too easy, though, to dismiss Slaughter's suspense novels as mere vehicles for gratuitous violence; instead, these novels use violent crime as vehicles for exploring the psychological scars crime leaves not only on its victims but also on the professionals who deal with it every day.A FAINT COLD FEAR starts off with a bang, with the discovery of the body of Andy Rosen, a young man who apparently committed suicide by jumping off a bridge. When medical examiner Sara Linton's extremely pregnant sister is stabbed at the scene, though, Sara and her ex-husband, police chief Jeffrey Tolliver, refuse to believe the two crimes are unrelated. Soon Sara and Jeffrey are caught up in unraveling family secrets and campus politics, as their investigation leads them into the classrooms and labs at the large university that dominates life in their small Georgia town.Because of the personal nature of the crime, Sara spends her time not only tracking down a killer but also worrying about the health of her seriously wounded sister. In addition, she finds herself questioning not only her growing involvement with Jeffrey but also her professional choices. At the psychological heart of the story, however, is Lena Adams, the former cop who has turned to working for campus security following her inability to recover psychologically from her sister's murder and her own rape in an earlier novel. Lena inexplicably becomes romantically involved with a menacing young man with a violent past, who also is one of the key suspects in the current rash of violent crimes around campus. This self-destructive relationship is one venue in which the author explores the legacy and scars of domestic abuse, a theme that runs throughout the book.Although Slaughter spends a lot of pages exploring the ways in which Lena's status as victim continues to affect her life and work, gone is the navel-gazing that disrupted the flow and pacing of Slaughter's previous novel, KISSCUT. Instead, A FAINT COLD FEAR sustains a suspenseful trajectory, with just enough red herrings to keep readers guessing. Although some loose ends are tied up almost as afterthoughts, one key plot twist, cleverly dangled out to careful readers in the book's closing paragraphs, will surprise many and keep everyone on the edge of their seats awaiting the next installment in Slaughter's series.--- Reviewed by Norah Piehl"

The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel,A Customer,5,"Margaret George's Cleopatra is a very real person - flawed, egotistical sometimes, brilliant at others, loveable, and self-deceiving, too. This book is certainly the epitome of the Historical Fiction genre. It is light reading, the narrative easy follow, and you never want to put it down. Most importantly, the main characters defy stereotypes, which makes for worthwhile reading, indeed.The time and place is richly described... my desire to visit the Greece and Rome (I have been to Egypt) is heightened. I particularly appreciated some of the details concerning the polemics of the gods / goddesses as they moved from Egypt to Greece to Rome, and how the author characterized characters by their patron gods / goddesses.This is great reading from an entertainment standpoint, which also (painlessly) provides a great history lesson and something to think about afterward."
Red Tent,A Customer,3,"I thought that the primary innovation of this book - telling the &quot;inversion&quot; of the story of the sons of Jacob by focusing on the role of the women left out of the Biblical account - was fascinating and well-done. However, Dinah and her four mothers were characterized only through the situations they found themselves in and their reactions to them. It reminded me of a newpaper account as opposed to a novel - I had hoped for more lavish characterization. I realize that this was an intentional style adopted by the author to echo the biblical account, however, it ended up being rather dry as a result. Disappointing only in so far as it failed to meet its potential. The basic premise of the book and execution of the plot were fabulous."
The Great Santini,A Customer,4,"Pat Conroy brings his characters from some world in which nobody can possibly be in the right situation. A military father, married to a gentle lady with weak children; a southern lady who has a vulgar family; a cynical girl with optimistic siblings; and a boy who just can't cut it being tough.Ben has the typical abusive military father. Ben draws some sense of false motivation from his father's insults and threats, so he never can truly grow by himself. Ben fears his father, yet at the same time, has some sense of loyalty that holds them together.Ben as a person is too weak to challenge his father's cruel treatments. He needs to conform to the expectations of his parents, as well as society, even though he is an outcast. Near the end of the book, when Ben assumes the role as family leader, although he has shown some growth, he hasn't avoided conforming to his father's expectations. Mary Anne still flicks tears at the back of his neck in the car, as she did to her father in the beginning.Conroy has the ability to place characters in seemingly impossible situations, and yet somehow their struggle makes a good story."
Men At Arms,A Customer,5,"I've decided he's too good and too prolific for me to write a brand new review every single time I read one of his books. Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat ""Bite me!""I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it."

She creates her own world, as realistic as ours, with a tragic, cruel, and cursed history for Hill House, the main character, and it's inhabitants. Perfect. All the characters aren't stereotypes; they're human. Eleanor might be an oddball hysteric, but she has a past which has made her that way.There are only about 4 actual hauntings in this book, but more than enough eerie sections, which are the real creepers... For instance, Eleanor's frolick through the house one night when all the others are sleeping, and her mood swing and sudden revulsion for her new best friend, Theodora, which just creeped me out. In the beginning when they had become immediate friends and were comparing themselves and their relatives to each other, they had marked themselves as obvious cousins. Readers of the book have to admit, in the part where Theodora must move into Eleanor's room because of the supernatural phenomena which had taken place in hers and she states cheerfully the two will be just like sisters, they were freaked the moment they read Eleanor simply say, spitefully, and out of earshot, &quot;Cousins.&quot;NEVER read this book during daytime, as I made that mistake never to read a page after nightfall... It still scared me, but it was ruined by my cowardice. The more this book scares you, the more you'll like it. After all, why would you keep reading it if you don't want to?"
Ambler Warning,Bookreporter,4,"Robert Ludlum lives on, at least in spirit. The latest work to be issued under his name, THE AMBLER WARNING, is a ghostwritten homage not only for Ludlum but also for Eric Ambler, a departed author who arguably is the father of 20th century espionage fiction. The Ambler of the novel, however, refers to a very confused man named Hal Ambler, who is in the middle of a major identity crisis.THE AMBLER WARNING opens at a clandestine psychiatric facility on a restricted-access island just off the coast of Virginia, within spitting distance of Langley. The facility ostensibly treats intelligence agents who may know too much or who are too dangerous to leave wandering among the general populace. One of these patients is Hal Ambler, who is kept heavily medicated and guarded at all times. When a hospital worker helps him escape, Ambler doesn't think twice before jumping, and almost immediately reverts to form in utilizing the training and skills that ultimately got him hospitalized in the first place.Ambler's immediate goal is to determine who caused him to be hospitalized, and why. There's one problem, however: Ambler does not exist. There is no record of him anywhere. Worse, when he looks in the mirror, he doesn't recognize the man he sees looking back. What Ambler does uncover, though, is that someone is attempting to frame him for the murders of foreign heads of state, with a most significant one being ready to occur within a rather short period of time. Ambler, with the might and majesty of the U.S. intelligence service hunting him, finds a couple of unlikely allies, including an agency number-cruncher who is able to extrapolate conclusions from raw data with extremely accurate results.Ambler himself has an amazing ability as well, one that permits him to read an individual's facial expressions and body language with unerring accuracy and thus determine their true intent and motivation; Ambler is, in other words, a veritable truth detector. But as he races to prevent an assassination that will have worldwide repercussions, Ambler discovers that everything he has come to believe may be wrong after all --- and the stakes are too high for error.THE AMBLER WARNING is reminiscent of the works of both its namesake and of Ludlum, though it is not quite the equal of either. It does, however, serve as a fine introduction for those unfamiliar with those works actually written by Ludlum during his lifetime. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is its conclusion. Those of a particular geopolitical bent could argue, quite correctly, that the good guys lost; for readers who keep abreast of world politics and economics, the ending will provide a number of elements for discussion.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"
