Alice's adventures in Wonderland and Through the looking glass,A Customer,5,"Find some children anywhere you can and read this book to them! I say this for your pleasure at least as much as theirs. Reading it out loud will be one of the delightful experiences of your life. Did I say ""reading?"" I should have said ""performing,"" because you will not be able to resist acting it out. Let yourself go--you will be a child again, yet still appreciate the book's adult insights.There is so much to say about this classic. It captures the psychology of a girl on the verge of growing up; it is full of jokes that appear absurd, but are fiendishly clever; it somehow avoids anything old-fashioned or politically incorrect; and absolutely all the characters are loveable, no matter how hard they try not to be.Carroll was an unhappy, aging man, yet he understood children to a spooky degree. While I smiled mildly at some of the humor, my children rolled around on the floor laughing.Here is an interesting phenomenon: When I read it as a child, I didn't particularly warm to it. When my children tried to read it on their own, they gave up. But the group experience of reading it out loud was a joy for all.Do I need to describe the plot? Could I if I tried? Alice may or may not be dreaming when she follows a rabbit down into his hole and enters a world where the simplest actions are strange and complicated. In her effort to explore this world and ultimately return home, nothing fits right, nothing seems to follow through properly, and no one she meets is sane. Alice, though a little girl, is given plenty of opportunities to be the rational, mature, assertive person of action.Everyone I discuss this book with, and I mean everyone, shudders and raises the issue of Carroll's alleged improprieties. They are invisible in the book, but to put your mind at ease, you may want to check out the judicious biography by Morton N. Cohen.The particular edition of Alice in Wonderland that I am reviewing, published by Grosset, is especially pleasant for reading out loud, with comfortable print, and Tenniel's essential illustrations."
Night And Day,A Customer,1,a complete wast of time and money a complete waste of time and money. the entire 7 chapters i read were nothing more than a long series of so and so said with a few so and so nodded thrown in. i never thought i woud come across the written word that would discourage reading. this is it
The Other Side Of Midnight,Avid Reader,5,"This book may never have won the Pultizer Prize or be labeled the best book of all time like Ulyssess - but its everything most of us want when we spend precious time on a book - it captivates from the moment you pick it up and read about beautiful Noelle and brilliant Katherine. It has everything - great characters, mystery, love, sex, killer ending, twists and turns. It has life of the rich and famous, a bit of life in Nazi France and outsmarting the Nazis. All in all - it entertains to the utmost. I listened to the audio - and had to keep driving around until I could get myself to stop long enough to park the car and get out. Loved it and can't wait to read/listen to the sequel."
Last Precinct,A Customer,3,"This book was better than the last few Scarpetta books were. It starts by reviewing the occurences at the end of the previous Scarpetta book BLACK NOTICE. So if you haven't read that one, you should before you proceed, or a lot of what happens won't make sense. Kay moves in temporarily with her friend Anna, who has secrets also (not really germaine to the story, but neither are big chunks of the book). There is a lot of psychological analyzing going on in this book, which leaves little room for any action. Some of it helps the plot, some of it doesn't.After moving in with Anna, Lucy and Teun and Marcino all get together to help Kay understand her current predicaments. A proscuter from New York gets dragged in as well. There are many little bombs dropped here and there about characters and events; in part , that is what kept me reading, to find out how it all made sense. In the end, lots of points here and there really didn't further the story at all. They were placed just to keep you guessing.I think this book could have used some better editing.BUT, having said all that, I am looking forward to the next installment. I want to know less about Kay and Lucy (the poster child for lesbian wondergirls) and more about Marcino and Rocky. That would be an interesting relationship to get feedback on. Without Benton, Marcino is one of more interesting characters in book. Let's here about what makes him tick, what made him the person he is.Just as an aside, my favorite Mystery series are those by Elizabeth George feature Lynley and Havers (and Simon and Helen and Deborah). That series leaves me begging for more. Go read them if you want to read a literary mystery series without a whining lead character."
Lover's Talisman,Avid Reader,5,Exiting new author Ashleigh Raine from the Publisher Ellora's Cave has a new novel for those lovers of supernatural paranormal bent... Shadow Walkers of Talisman Bay protect the inhabitants from demons werewolves vampires. Thrilling and Exciting this is a delicious novel that will make your toes curl and with some creepy character hunky heroes all added to the mix.Worth buying this gem and its a collector
The Fellowship of the Ring,A Customer,4,"This is a great book, but i think it is the most flawed of the series. The first hundred pages drag badly. Even once the team gets going, things are slow until after the big conference in elf land. Despite the start, the book moves on into some of the best, genre-creating work by the end. If you want to know why 10 million people play WoW, this is the series that started it all."
Maggie's Hope,A Customer,5,"Maggie's Hope is a great summer read, specially on the beach! Reading about these robust, hearty women dealing with and overcoming hardships that we can relate to even in modern times, has given me hope that life today ain't all that bad considering the 'good old days'. There are some good characters I loved to hate but I won't say more... Too bad it isn't a paperback, but it's still worth the money."
The Intelligencer,Avid Reader,2,"Based on the reviews, I thought this book would be an interesting read. The premise certainly sounded interesting. A dash of The DaVinci Code and a bit of The Eight, but this book doesn't come close to being as good as those it's compared to. I found the main charcter to be over the top and predictable, her storyline not even interesting. The flashbacks to Christopher Marlowe and Elizabethan England had the potential to be interesting, but just fall flat. I couldn't even force myself to finish this boring novel."
Oceans Apart,A Customer,5,wow this was a wonderful story. it made me cry and smile at the same time. i truly believe what max said you can not love unless you forgive.
"Something To Kill For: When It Comes To Garage Sales, Finding A Treasure Can Be Murder...",Avid Reader,4,"I picked this up at the library the other day, expecting a little story to pass the time. Instead I was rewarded with a little gem of a mystery centered around...yard sales. Mrs. Avid Reader says it is truly amazing what you can learn by reading and I have to agree. I thought yard sales were for broken down couches, old tools, 10-year old shirts and gifts from Aunt Erma. Apparently though, depending on the ""socio-economic"" class of the neighborhood it is possible to find a diamond in the rough.In this case, one of the yard sale buyers / antique dealers found something worth killing over and the only clue is her dying last word, JAP. Of course there is an Oriental lady with a husband (professor, who else?) who dislikes policemen viscerally. There are the playboys, those who collect Art Deco (our heroine), modern, Oriental or eclectic. Directing the investigation is Lt. Karl Genesco, former professional NFL star with the Steelers. Anneke is a software developer (semi-realistic descriptions) who does work for the police. The two meet, fall for each other and solve the crime. Nothing complex, deep or soul-searching - just a good yarn about Ann Arbor and the people who live there."
Silence in Hanover Close,A Customer,5,I have only read 2 books by Anne - &quot;Farrier's Lane&quot; and Bluegate Fields&quot;. Anne Perry has shown us a great mystery within a victorian era. My goal is to read all Anne Perry's books. This book is probably the best I have read out of the three. You won't be disappointed whe reading an Anne Perry novel.
Heart of Darkness and the Secret Sharer,A Customer,1,there goes 5 hours of my life i will never get backwhat a waste of time who the hech was kuntz anyway
Island of the Swans,A Customer,5,"I am thrilled that Ciji Ware's Island of the Swans has been reissued with the beautiful cover it deserves! I read it years ago, and realized that despite it's original cheesy cover, this was a truly amazing historical novel, not a romance. I also noticed that this 20th anniversary edition included the story of the heroine, Jane Maxwell, 4th Duchess of Gordon's fascinating involvement in the Madness Crisis of George III, which the edition I read in the 90's didn't have. For anyone who saw the movie ""Duchess"" about the Duchess of Devonshire, you can read all about her rival, the Duchess of Gordon-- who was equally intriguing. If you want to be swept away with this ""Gone with the Wind of Scotland"" saga, you'll love this novel!"
Playing for the Ashes,Avid Reader,5,"I have read all the Elizabeth George mysteries starting with A Great Deliverance that I happened to buy one night at a book store. I was ready to walk out and the sales lady said, ""Try this one if you like mystery and intelligence."" I was hooked.In this one, George takes a sharp turn. The complexity is still present but there is a bitterness here not found in her prior works. She never employs random killings, senseless crimes, or madmen. What she does do is paint a heart-rending portrait of the human condition better than anyone I know. Character and plot develop together - a difficult task that seems to be her forte. I wondered how the seemingly disparate parts related but never fear, they are joined in an incredible ending.The characters in this book continue to haunt me. Ones feelings toward the ""heroine"" slowly evolve from revulsion to anger to pity to awe as the story proceeds. The way she connects animal rights, disease, sports and above all, human relations, is superb. This is without a doubt one of the finest mysteries ever penned."
One Last Time,A Customer,5,"&quot;One Last Time&quot; was an amazing book. I've watched John Edward at work for a few years, and he amazes me daily. This book lets you know the real John Edward, from growing up to working and developing his awesome gift. I've already ordered his new book &quot;Crossing Over&quot;, which is going to be published in August. John is just one of those people you always want to be around.This book also is easy to read. It's well written and very plyable. The content flows from one chapter to another without any breaks. The book is actually on my desk at the moment, one great read!"
"Evelina, or, A young lady's entrance into the world",Avid Reader,5,"This book is fantastic! It is so entertaining and engages the reader from the first page. This is actually the first review I've written, but I just finished this book and had to tell someone what fun it was to read and what an excellent writer and character-developer Ms. Burney was. I am a big Jane Austen fan, but I have to say this was even more entertaining than my favorite Austen works. I usually read to relax, but this book kept me on the edge of the couch page after page wondering what crazy event would take place next. While I read, I kept imagining 18th/19th century women reading this book aloud to each other and gasping and swooning. I've finished this book with a big smile on my face."
Shadow Puppets,A Customer,5,Just a masterpiece by Orson Scott Card. One of the best books I have ever read. The Ender and Bean books are the best and they have changed my life forever. For the better of course
Beautiful Lies: A Novel,A Customer,3,"When I staerted reading this book I really couldnt put it down. It has all the ingredients for a page turner. Why the 3 stars you ask? That's one reason. She is conatantly asking the reader questions and making &#34;asides&#34; I enjoy being a bystander not a participant. I also noticed how the main character was inconsistant, smart at getting some things and slow at other times. The way the author wrote was that you really wernt too far ahead of wat the characters knew, however, when Ridley or Jake made their apiphanies found myself saying &#34;yeah no crap ( no $?*!) I already knew this&#34;The book is an easy read and is a good mystery type book. I would have payed more for the book as for the most part enjoyed the read."
"The Silver Hand (The Song of Albion, Book Two)",Avid Reader,4,"After the somewhat disappointing first book in this series, The Silver Hand turned to be quite good. The plot is exciting, the action is non-stop, and the Celtic lore was very interesting. Moreover, there were moments in this novel when I had to put the book down because could believe what had just happened. People are maimed, women raped and murdered, entire nations put to the sword. In fact, there were times when I thought the violence depicted went too far, but I also felt it was in keeping with the setting and alternate time period so it had to he accepted. If I had to make one complaint about the novel, it's that the ending was tied up a little too neatly, but not so bad that I didn't thoroughly enjoy the novel."
FROM A BUICK 8 (True first edition),A Customer,5,"Fantastic! The best King ever! Buy it now, because it's destined to become a classic, and you'll want to own the first edition of this incredibly horrific novel.Also recommended: The Dead Zone, Carrie, Salem's Lot, The Green Mile, etc."
Barney's Version,A Customer,5,"I really enjoyed this book. It is well written,the characters are great, and I found myselflaughing out loud while reading it. It is thebest book I have read this year. The endingis one of the best yet!"
Of Mice And Men,A Customer,5,"This short book is a very quick read, yet is as profound as one would expect. It is the story about two friends, and the way they care for each other. The narration is elequently written and the descriptions are breath-taking. If you are looking for a great piece of literature, this is a wonderful choice."
Cat's Cradle,A Customer,5,This book was pure comic genius using dark ironic humor. One of the greatest books ever. I love it so much all of you should read it!
Texas,Avid Reader,4,"This is a good overview of Texas history. It was written by Michener, so is, as one would expect, very long. It is a slightly different format than others of his novels, though. It flips back and forth between the current day and stories of history. Current day has folks from a representative set of backgrounds. The history story takes each of those people and frames historical tales around their ancestors. At various points the histories of the ancestors intermingle and the current-day folks realize that they are linked with each other."
Watership Down,A Customer,5,"I like this book very much because it was filled with action, drama & comedy. For example, it has 12 rabbits that have to travel on a dangerous journey to escape danger and start a new warren (home). The characters are a mix: strong, smart, weak...One knew how to lead and by working together they all got to a place on top of the hill where they were safe and no one got hurt...."
Once a Princess,A Customer,4,"Overall, this is a wonderful book. I love the premise of a ""lost princess"" who by some very bad luck has ended up working in a sleazy tavern, only to be ""rescued"" by a king. What is great is that Tanya is believable in the sense that she doesn't believe that the foreign men are telling her the truth, (I mean who would believe a story like that??) and she tries VERY hard to escape them b/c she thinks they mean her harm. The book is actually much funnier than I remembered and much of this is due to the lovable characters and their chemistry as a group. I love the supporting characters as well as the main couple. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the fighting b/t the couple went on too long, it could have been resolved much more quickly and realistically if people would speak to eachother instead of getting so angry over nothing and then avoiding eachother for LONG periods of time. Also, the fighting went on so long that it became a little difficult to see when exactly this couple fell in love, they certainly had a physical connection, and it was really sweet how protective and possessive Stefan was towards Tanya, but I couldn't remember why they actually LIKED eachother. Sadly this is somewhat typical of JL novels b/c she often focuses more on physical attraction b/t a couple instead of their non-sexual relationship. But still, this is a fun read and a cute story that I found entertaining."
The Vision of Emma Blau,Avid Reader,5,"When I read Ursula Hegi, I pack my bags in order to stay a while. Ursula is all meat and potatoes cooked slightly German with a touch of good old American apple pie. Stephan's vision of Emma that prompted the ambitious project that resulted in the Wasserburg was a foretelling more awe-inspiring than the grandeur the hotel once gave to the small New Hampshire community. Stephan was unable to fully embrace his 3rd wife after losing the first 2 wives. I'm fully convinced he never would have been able to sufficiently love the first 2 wives even if one of them had lived. The dream of America, which prompted his departure from Germany when he was 13, was his first love that drove all other passions. The Wasserburg, though a fantasy straight from his first wife, was his true love. His granddaughter, Emma, would inherit the problems associated with the aging of the building due to the inherited passion. Unable to commit to a love of her own, she dug her heels into the hotel that was made on borrowed money from her grandfather's first wife's family. Stephan did not honor the loan, and left that legacy to Emma, as well. Emma in her blind addiction to the aging Wasserburg, debunked a promise to her bother, tricked her mother, and like her grandfather: put her life into something that would never reciprocate. Ursula's words beat to the drum of a human heart, and though imperfect, vulnerable, and ruled by insensible passions, the reader is left missing the characters that are forever imbedded in the fabric of our blended cultures."
Moloka'i,Avid Reader,5,"Moloka'i is an incredible historical fiction novel about Rachel, a young girl who contracts leprosy and is arrested and condemned to the island of Moloka'i, a leper colony back in the 1800s. The story was terribly sad, but very well written and as Rachel's life progresses, the history is fascinating, including bits about the first plane flying over the island, World War II, and the internment of the Japanese in California during the war. I knew about the leper colony, but before reading this book hadn't realized how terribly the families of patients with leprosy were treated and often shunned by society out of fear. That's not even to mention how horrible it was for men, women, and children to be ripped from their families to live in quarantine without their consent.This book was so interesting and I loved reading Rachel's story and how the historical events affected her throughout the years. That was fascinating. Very sad, though. Great book!"
PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD),A Customer,5,"I've decided he's too good and too prolific for me to write a brand new review every single time I read one of his books. Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat ""Bite me!""I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it."
Odd Thomas,A Customer,5,I am a fourteen year old boy and i read ALOT of books. I was told to give this one a shot and I did. The incredible thing is that koontz writes it with such style that i am drawn into it. I never want the tory to end bexause I feel like I am Odd Thomas. Odd is actually very normal. His mother is quite insane but it doesnt really matter to him. he could not be any more average with his being a frycook and his loving elvis. The major difference is that he is accompanied by elvis every day. He sees ghosts.
Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels),Avid Reader,2,"This is the second Stephanie Laurens book I've read and it will definitely be my last. I borrowed it because it reviewed so highly, but was disgusted at the end of 30 pages. Like several other reviewers I was incredulous that Devil was planning his marriage to a woman he had just met as his dying young cousin lay steps away. Predictable plot, uninteresting characters with stupid names, and many historical inaccuracies. It was a chore to finish."
Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels),A Customer,1,WARNING! This book suffers from being overly descriptive. This author apparantly just bought a new thesaurus and thought she should use every word in it. It is about a good a book as you would expect from an author who names her hero something so incredibly stupid as DEVIL.
Tea Rose,Avid Reader,5,"I have to admit that I've not read The Tea Rose, but picked up the follow-on ""The Winter Rose"" at a train station. I was looking for something easy to read during my four and a half hour train ride and was positively surprised and captivated by Donnelly's book. Although, at times a little too mushy for my taste, the book was hard to put down! It reads as if you're watching a movie and does not have a single dull moment in it. I'm looking forward to Donnelly's next book as I'm positive Willa and Seamie will see each other again!"
Satanic Verses,A Customer,5,"All the notoreity and religious bigotry aroused by this book turned me off. For 15 years I put off reading it. I was the loser. This is the best novel of the twentieth century! Rushdie is the only writer I know who understands the multi-cultural/multi-racial world into which we are now stumbling. Rushdie loves his characters but not so much he cannot see their faults and gleefully but compassionately point them out. I've never met an author as honest with his/her characters as Rushdie. Having finished this book, I sat speechless for almost an hour. No book has ever done that to me before!"
"Persuader (Jack Reacher, No. 7)",A Customer,5,Having never read a Reacher novel before I wasnt sure what to expect. I found this story to be almost addicting. The author captured me and made it very difficult to put down my kindle. Thank you for allowing me to experience this. I am hoping to read all the Reacher novels from number1 to the end.
"Persuader (Jack Reacher, No. 7)",Avid Reader,5,"Again, Lee Child weaves a story that makes me lose a little sleep. I can't put my kindle down until I read on through. I discovered the Jack Reacher series by accident and I'm so glad I did. It weaves mystery and suspense and great characters into a story that is captivationg and memorable. Isn't that all we can expect!I recommend it highly!"
Point of origin,A Customer,3,"I found the book to be considerably less enjoyable than herothers. The characters seemed much less real, overly bitter, and theending leaves many aspects of the Point Of Origin of the fires with too little explanation."
Evelina,Avid Reader,5,"This book is fantastic! It is so entertaining and engages the reader from the first page. This is actually the first review I've written, but I just finished this book and had to tell someone what fun it was to read and what an excellent writer and character-developer Ms. Burney was. I am a big Jane Austen fan, but I have to say this was even more entertaining than my favorite Austen works. I usually read to relax, but this book kept me on the edge of the couch page after page wondering what crazy event would take place next. While I read, I kept imagining 18th/19th century women reading this book aloud to each other and gasping and swooning. I've finished this book with a big smile on my face."
The last temptation of Christ,Avid Reader,5,"Kazanzakis portrays a Jesus with whom we can relate. Most people know that the stories from the New Testament, while beautiful and consoling, were written 40 to 60 years after the events described. They are quite selective, adding up to only a few days. And no one thinks Jesus went around addressing himself in the third person or especially that he proclaimed himself &quot;God's son&quot;. The idea of God fathering a human child was a Greek concept and was considered blasphemous by Jews.The book almost shimmers as one is transported back to that ancient age. It is a time machine in every sense of the word and the Jesus we meet here is a normal man with brothers and sisters and a mother. But he is troubled with visions. The realization that something great is afoot comes to him slowly, in flashes, as if a puzzle were slowly being revealed. More than anything this Jesus is a man, not a God. Yet he seems connected to the divine spark and in particular to the God of the Israelites.We view his journeys, his love for Mary, his teachings which seem to emerge almost spontaneously, then that last epic week we know as the Passion. The &quot;last temptation&quot; occurs on the cross in which Jesus is given a vision of the life he might could have. He marries, makes love, fathers children, works as a carpenter and lives happily. But he rejects that vision and suddenly raises his head realizing he is still high in the air, nailed to the cross. He did not flinch from his mission nor did he take the easy way out.Theologically speaking it was condemened as heresy and banned by the Greek Orthodox church. It was not meant as an official biography of &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; (many consider that his last name) but as what might have been. And for that reason it deserves great kudos."
Closed Circle,A Customer,4,"I have been a book addict since little and specailly a mistery novel fan. Recently, I often got so bored with junk publication of mystery novels but When I first encountered his book I knew that he was genius! TAKE NO FAREWELL, PAINTING THE DARKNESS, PAST CARING, INTO THE BLUE, HAND IN GLOVE, BEYOND RECALL, OUT OF SUN.... I still have more Goddards to read but my personal top 3 so far would be PAINTING THE DARKNESS, PAST CARING and INTO THE BLUE. CLOSED CIRCLE is a good book although it may lack the twist and mystery compared to other books by Goddard. But I am so attached to this book and keep reading in order just to reach the ending, which is my favorite part and the most beautiful ending by Goddard which envoke visual and emotional sensation as if I were there. The last few sentences, I can even recall as it is so beautiful and so sad. (This novel is not as sad as other Goddard's books, though) I would love to read sequal if any."
The Big Sleep,Avid Reader,5,"This is my all-time favorite book. You can read it a 1,000 times and still be spellbound by Chandler's humor, his original scenes and his feel for all things dark but human. I loved this book the first time I read it, and whenever I need a good laugh and an adventure into dark psychology, I always go for The Big Sleep.There is a modern version that features a female Philip Marlowe called TROUBLE IS HER BUSINESS. It doesn't incorporate all of Chandler's gifts, but does a better job of living up to The Big Sleep than any work since."
